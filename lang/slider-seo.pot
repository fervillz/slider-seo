"result, search engines need to rely on captions around the image, alt text, "

"using a generic term like \\\"image\\\" or \\\"photo\\\" or a file name that "
"doesn't use keywords doesn't give search engines much meaningful information "
"on what the image is about. Linking to an image with keywords is helpful to "
